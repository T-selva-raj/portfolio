                I’m an Angular–Node.js Developer with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering and 2 years of
                experience building
                full-stack web applications. I began my career focusing on backend development using Node.js and
                Express.js, where I
                created scalable REST APIs and worked extensively with MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.
                As my passion for frontend development grew, I transitioned into working with Angular, Angular Material,
                and modern UI
                libraries like PrimeNG and Tailwind CSS, allowing me to contribute to complete end-to-end solutions.

                    I'm eager to learn, enjoy working in creative settings, and love solving problems.
